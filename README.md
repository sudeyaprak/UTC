# UTC

1. Input:
The code asks the user to input the following values:
- Year
- Month
- Day
- Second of day

2. Storing Input:
The code stores the user input in a list called `UTC`. The list is initialized as an empty list and then the user's input is added to it in the following order: [Year, Month, Day, Second of day].

3. Data Validation:
The code uses a series of if statements to check the validity of the user's input for each element in the `UTC` list. It checks the following conditions:
- The year must be greater than 1971.
- The month must be an integer between 1 and 12.
- The day must be an integer between 1 and 31.
- The second of the day must be between 0 and 86400 (inclusive).

If any of these conditions are not met, the code prints an error message.

4. Leap Seconds:
The code defines a list called `leap_second_epoch`, which contains tuples representing dates on which leap seconds were introduced. Each tuple consists of (Day, Month, Year).

5. Determining Leap Second Value (N):
The code iterates through the `leap_second_epoch` list to find the most recent leap second epoch that is before or on the user-provided date (Year, Month, Day). Once it finds the correct epoch, it sets the variable `N` to the index of that epoch in the list. Then, it adds the value of `N` to the `Second of day` provided by the user in the `UTC` list.

Note: The code doesn't consider all historical leap second events, as there might be new leap seconds after the last epoch listed in `leap_second_epoch`.

It's worth noting that this code seems to be attempting to handle leap seconds, which are introduced periodically to keep atomic time (UTC) close to mean solar time (UT1). However, the implementation seems incomplete and may not fully account for all leap second occurrences and rules.

Please note that leap seconds are typically announced by international timekeeping organizations, and it is essential to use an accurate and up-to-date source for leap second data. This code uses a fixed list of historical leap second events, which may not be updated with future occurrences.
